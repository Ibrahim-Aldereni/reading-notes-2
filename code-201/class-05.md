# **HTML & CSS (Ch5-Ch11-Ch12) Notes:**

## Ch5 Notes:
+ To add image to tour page you must use `<img>` tag, and wit hthe following attributes:
  + src >> stand for source and it's the relative URL of the image.
  + alt >> stand for alternative and it's the text shown if the image broken.
  + title >> text shown when hover over the photo.  

```html
<img src='img/logo.png' alt='logo' title='logo of the main page'>
```

+ Because `<img>` is inline element it can set withing block elements without start new line.

![imgPlace](img/imagePlace.png)
  
+ There is 3 rules to focus on when dealing with images:
  + Save the images in right format, websites usually use (jpeg, gif, or png).
  + Save Images at the right width and height.
  + Use correct resolution.

+ Use JPEG format when having many different colors in a picture, and use PNG or GIF if the picture have few colors or large areas of the same color.

+ Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image will not make it look better but it will increase hte time of loading becuase the size of the image will be biggar.

+ JPEG, PNG and GIF called **bitmap images** nad changing the dimension of the image will affect the quality of it, on the other hand SVG type images which called **vector images** is resolution-independent so you can change the dimensions of the image without affecting the quality of it.

![bitmap](img/bitmap.jpg)


+ `<figure>` tag used to contain images that share the same caption. `<figcaption>` used to add caption to an image.
