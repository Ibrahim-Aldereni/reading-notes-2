# **(Domain Modeling) Notes:**

+ Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models using object-oriented programming (OOP):
  + When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
  + Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
  + Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
  + Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
  + Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
  + Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
